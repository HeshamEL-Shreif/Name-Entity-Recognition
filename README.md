# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

This repository contains the implementation of various Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, including Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and BERT-based models. The goal of this project is to compare traditional and advanced machine learning techniques for NER tasks.

## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial Information Extraction (IE) task that identifies and classifies entities in text such as names of people, locations, organizations, and other specialized strings. This project explores multiple approaches to NER, showcasing their performance and effectiveness.

### Key Components

1. **Introduction**: Overview of NER and the approaches used in this project.
2. **Dataset**: Description of the datasets used, including preprocessing steps.
3. **Baseline Experiments**: Evaluation of CRF and LSTM models.
4. **Advanced Experiments**: Evaluation of a fine-tuned BERT model.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and performance insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, etc.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn transformers torch
```

### Dataset

This project uses two datasets:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Corpus**: Contains sentences with associated POS and NER tags.
2. **WNUT17 Dataset**: Focuses on emerging and rare entities with IOB2 labels.

The datasets are divided into training, validation, and test sets. For detailed preprocessing steps, refer to the [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocessing) section.

### Models

1. **Conditional Random Fields (CRF) Model**
   - Used to establish a baseline for sequence classification.
   - Results: Precision: 0.8675, Recall: 0.8388, F1-Score: 0.8529

2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model**
   - Bidirectional LSTM with pre-trained embeddings.
   - Results: Precision: 0.61, Recall: 0.67, Loss: 0.1005 (training), 0.9501 (test)

3. **BERT Model**
   - Fine-tuned pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face.
   - Results: Epoch 1 - Precision: 0.6073, Recall: 0.2623, F1-Score: 0.3663, Accuracy: 0.9400
   - Results: Epoch 2 - Precision: 0.5598, Recall: 0.3253, F1-Score: 0.4115, Accuracy: 0.9419

## Data Preprocessing

**Named Entity Recognition (NER) Corpus:**

1. Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio).
3. Handle null values.
4. Feature engineering including word, POS tag, capitalization, and shape.

**WNUT17 Dataset:**

1. Tokenize using the Hugging Face library.
2. Align labels with tokens, ensuring proper handling of sub-word tokenization.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the models, follow these steps:

1. **Training**: Run the training scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory for each model.
2. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using the provided test scripts.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: For BERT, adjust hyperparameters and fine-tune using the `fine_tuning.py` script.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of different NER models, with BERT showing significant improvements in precision and recall. Traditional models like CRF offer strong performance for basic tasks, while advanced models like BERT excel in handling complex and emerging entities.

## Future Work

- Explore additional pre-trained transformer models.
- Investigate methods to improve LSTM performance and handle memory constraints.
- Extend to other NLP tasks and datasets.
